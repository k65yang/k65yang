## About me
I am a fourth year computer science student at UBC, part of the BCS program. My expected graduation year is somewhere around 2022 or 2023; I am in no rush to graduate as I want to take the opportunity to do co-ops to explore different faucets of the industry. Currently, a junior developer at AppNeta working with their monitoring point platforms team.

I am also a second degree student. I did my civil engineering degree at the University of Waterloo (graduated 2020). I did five co-ops within the civil field and worked full time for about half a year before getting the opportunity to be a part of the BCS program.
